It took me two days to build this blog with Jekyll, but less than two minutes for the name: schu-wald. Schu simply stands for me, because the pronunciation of schu in German is the same as a word in my name, and also the same as the pronunciation of tree in Chinese. German word Wald means forest. Me-Forest and Tree-Forest are exactly what schuwald means.

I have to admit, it’s not a funny pun. I can even see someone groaning in front of the computer screen now. Sorry guys, but I just love the imagery so much and I believe it could goes back to a passage I read as a child in A Sand County Almanac:

…It is in midwinter that I sometimes glean from my pines something more important than woodlot politics, and the news of the wind and weather. This is especially likely to happen on some gloomy evening when the snow has buried all irrelevant detail, and the hush of elemental sadness lies heavy upon every living thing. Nevertheless, my pines, each with his burden of snow, are standing ramrod-straight, rank upon rank, and in the dusk beyond I sense the presence of hundreds more. At such times I feel a curious transfusion of courage…


I think we are all pine trees in a dense forest. Although sometimes the night is so dark that we can't even see each other's silhouettes, whenever there is wind, there is a rustling sound. That’s a way of symbiosis.

Welcome to schuwald and listen to my sound.
